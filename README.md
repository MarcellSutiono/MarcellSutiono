## 🤵 About Me
I’m a passionate developer with a strong interest in **Game Programming**, but I also love exploring new technologies!

Currently diving into :
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence
- 📱 Mobile Development with Kotlin
- 🎮 Unity

I enjoy learning outside of my comfort zone and experimenting with different fields.  

Some things I’ve tried so far:
- 🎮 Many game projects with **Unity and C#**
- 🖥️ Developing Desktop Applications with **Tauri + Rust**  
- 🌐 Web Programming with **Go + React + gRPC**  

And I can’t wait to learn even more new things! 😉
